#WHAT THE HELL IS JS-RPG? 

JS-RPG is a little game written in basic Web Languages in which you are able to play through RPG-like turn-based games.

And it uses Javascript, of course.



#May I use the files of JS-RPG to create my own games?

You may, but at the moment I can't recommended it. That's mainly due to the fact that the project is far from finished and therefore the comments aren't particularly helpful.



#Does JS-RPG use any dependecies?

Yes, it does. Since document.cookie is such a fuss to use, this website uses Cookies.JS by Scott Hamper. 
It's perfect for these purposes.
